# Auto Vulnerability Tester
An extensible automated vulnerability testing framework written in Python3 by Nicholas Lochner for CS460 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The source is licensed under the GNU GPL v3, except for "heartbleed.py", which is a modified version of the POC by Jared Stafford and has no copyright.

###Features
- Uses nmap to scan a given list of IP addresses.
- Includes a website crawler which aggregates all URLs on a host to determine which URLs could potentially be vulnerable to different exploits.
- Includes metasploit auxiliary module support.
- Writes vulnerability results to a json file (results.json) upon completion.

###Exploits tested
The program tests for the following exploits:
- Heartbleed
- Shellshock
- XSS vulnerabilities
- (Optionally, if metasploit is used) A return to libc buffer overflow exploit 

###Requirements
- Python3 on a Linux/Unix machine.
- Metasploit Framework (optional)

Required Python libraries:
- nmap
- argparse
- netifaces (optional)
- requests


###Installation

Metasploit installation instructions can be found in: "metasploit_install_instructions.txt"

Vulnerable test VM setup:


###Usage

- Populate the file, ip_list.txt with a list of IP Adresses to test seperated by a newline character.
- (Optional) populate the file, cgi_list.txt, with a list of CGI paths to test.

```sh
usage: tester.py [-h] [-v] -p SHELLSHOCK_PORT [-ip SHELLSHOCK_IP]
                 [--metasploit-path MS_PATH] [--rvm-path RVM_PATH]
                 [--ret-to-libc-port RTOLIBC_PORT]


  -p SHELLSHOCK_PORT    Listening port for shellshock test.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v                    Verbose output.
  -ip SHELLSHOCK_IP     (Optional, specify if IP is not found automatically.)
                        Listening IP for shellshock test.
  --metasploit-path MS_PATH
                        Specify the path to metasploit.
  --rvm-path RVM_PATH   Path to ruby version manager.
  --ret-to-libc-port RTOLIBC_PORT
                        Specify port to test for return to libc buffer
                        overflow attack.
```
